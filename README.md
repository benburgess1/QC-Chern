This repository contains an implementation of the quantum algorithm introduced by Niedermeier et al. (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.043288) for calculating the Chern number of a system. The implementation is performed using the IBM Qiskit library in python. It is first implemented and tested on the noiseless quantum simulators, and then progressed to noisy quantum simulators and real quantum devices.
